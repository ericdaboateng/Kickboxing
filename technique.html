            <br><p>Moving forwards and backwards quickly and efficiently, can’t get more basic, right? footwork is to be deft and simplistic, allowing the fighter to move in and out of striking range as quickly as possible. Footwork is key to generating sufficient power in the basic strikes. </p><br>

            <h4>Forwards-to-backwards/Backwards-to-forwards</h4>
            <p>Get in your fighting stance - step forwards - step backwards - Repeat.<br> Get in your fighting stance - step backwards- step forwards - Repeat.</p><br>

            <h4>Forwards-forwards-backwards-forwards-forwards</h4>
            <p>The next drill is to replicate an offensive fighter moving in to strike his opponent, evading a counter-punch (by moving backwards) and continuing the attack. Keep the movement as free flowing as possible.<br>Get in your fighting stance - steps forward - step backwards - steps forward - Repeat.</p><br>

            <h4>Backwards-backwards-forwards-backwards</h4>
            <p>This drill is to replicate being on the defence against an opponent that is chasing you down. <br>Get in your fighting stance - steps backwards - step forwards - steps backwards – Repeat</p><br>

            <h4>Side step</h4>
            <p>When defending it's not always a good idea or an option to move back in a straight line. Sometimes a simple side step or angler movement is enough.
            <br>Get in your fighting stance - side step to the left - side step to the right - steps to the left - steps to the right – Repeat.</p>
         </div>

         <div id="punchesbasic" class="tab-pane fade">
            <br><p>Kickboxing has many kinds of punches, each designed to accomplish a different objective in the ring. When you are throwing your punches, remember that your elbows should be beside the body as much as possible. When you throw a punch, bring your arms back to the block position</p><br>

            <h4>The Jab</h4>
            <p>One of the most basic punches is the jab, a fast, straight punch to your opponent's head or body that is used to set him up for further blows and drive him back.
            Power is commonly derived by stepping into the punch, rotating the hips followed by the torso, shoulder, and wrist just prior to striking.
            </p><br>

            <h4>The Cross</h4>
            <p>A crossing punch is sometimes referred to as a straight punch or reverse punch and is most effective when thrown in a “one, two” combo – jab followed by cross. This is seen as a fighter power punch. it is thrown by the rear hand from the guard. As with the jab, and most strikes whether kicks or punches, power comes from rotating of the hips and the movement of the legs, torso and the wrist.</p><br>

            <h4>The Hook</h4>
            <p>This punch is also a power punch and is most commonly thrown with the front hand. The hook is also an effective weapon to use when counter-striking and close combat. To create as much power as possible to put behind your hook, step into the punch with your lead leg by turning your foot about 90 degrees.</p><br>

            <h4>The Uppercut</h4>
            <p>the strike involves moving the fist in an upward motion.
            When executing an uppercut punch from the guard, the shoulder lowers with the knees and then the body is propelled forward and upwards, extending the fist towards the chin and face area.
            </p>

         </div>
         <div id="kicksbasic" class="tab-pane fade">
            <br><p>While Kickboxing, its important to concider that the human leg is longer and stronger than the arm, kicks are generally used to keep an opponent at a distance, surprise him or her with their range, and inflict substantial damage. On the other hand, your stance is very important, and any attempt to deliver a kick will necessarily compromise one's stability of stance. The application of kicks is thus a question of the tradeoff between the power that can be delivered vs. the cost incurred to balance. be mindful with this</p><br>

            <h4>The front kick</h4>
            <p>The front kick in martial arts is a kick executed by lifting the knee straight forward, while keeping the foot and shin either hanging freely or pulled to the hip, and then straightening the leg in front of the practitioner and striking the target area. It is desirable to retract the leg immediately after delivering the kick, to avoid the opponent trying to grapple the leg and (unless a combination is in process) to return to stable fighting stance.</p><br>

            <h4>The side kick</h4>
            <p>The side kick refers to a kick that is delivered sideways in relation to the body of the person kicking. It is one of the most adaptable kicks, useful as both an offensive move and as a defensive counter to a blitzing opponent. There are two areas that are commonly used as impact points in sidekicks: the heel of the foot or the outer edge of the foot. The heel is more suited to hard targets such as the ribs, stomach, jaw, temple and chest. However, when executing a side kick with the heel, the toes should be pulled back so that they only make contact the heel and not with the whole foot. </p><br>

            <h4>The Roundhouse kick</h4>
            <p>The roundhouse kick swings your leg sideways in a circular motion, kicking the opponent's side with the front of the leg, usually with the instep, ball of the foot, toe, or shin. Also performable is a 360-degree kick in which the attacker performs a full circle with their leg, in which the striking surface is generally either the instep, shin or ball of the foot.</p><br>

               <br/><h4>Back Fist</h4>
               <p>The back fist often used to surprise an opponent after a martial artist has missed with a standard straight punch. With this technique, you hit the opponent with the back of your fist and knuckles. This punch can be used as a finisher, to disorient an attacker or to strike the bridge of nose in order to make an escape</p><br/>

               <h4>Spinning Back Fist</h4>
               <p>This is a deceptive technique that can catch an opponent off guard (as the martial artist seems to be initially turning away from the opponent). Moreover, the spin of this technique adds momentum and thus it is very powerful striking technique</p><br/>

               <h4>A Superman punch</h4>
               <p>Is a technique used in kickboxing, The technique involves bringing the rear leg forward to feign a kick, then snapping the leg back while throwing a cross, which should result in greater power behind the punch.</p><br/>

               <h4>An Overhand punch</h4>
               <p>Is a semi-circular and vertical punch thrown with the rear hand. It is usually employed when the opponent is bobbing or slipping. The strategic utility of the drop relying on body weight can deliver a great deal of power.</p><br/>
            </div>

            <div id="interkicks" class="tab-pane fade">
               <br/><h4>Back Kick</h4>
               <p>Start in your kicking stance. You will use your rear leg in this kick. If you are in a right kicking stance, turn your body to the right until you are facing directly away from your target. During this movement, you should pivot on your left foot. Continue turning to the right and look over your right shoulder (look at your target - you need to see what you are hitting). Lift your right knee to your chest (think of kicking like a mule). Drive the heel of your foot straight back towards your opponent. After hitting your target, quickly resume kicking stance so you can prepare for your next kick.</p><br/>

               <h4>The hook kick </h4>
               <p>Strikes with the heel from the side (or flat of the foot in sparring). It is executed similar to a side kick. However, the kick is intentionally aimed slightly off target in the direction of the kicking foot's toes. At full extension, the knee is bent and the foot snapped to the side, impacting the target with the heel. it is considered a very high level technique in said circumstance. There are many variations of the hook kick, generally based on different footwork’s: rear- or front-leg, oblique or half-pivot, dropping, spin-back and more. The hook kick can be delivered with a near-straight leg at impact, or with a hooked where the leg bends before impact to catch the target from behind. An important variation is the downward hook kick, delivered as a regular or a spin-back kick, in which the end of the trajectory is diagonally downwards for a surprise effect or following an evading opponent.</p><br/>

               <h4>An axe kick</h4>
               <p>Is characterized by a straightened leg with the heel descending onto an opponent like the blade of an axe. It begins with one foot rising upward as in a crescent kick. The upward arc motion is stopped, and then the attacking foot is lowered so as to strike the target from above. The arc can be performed in either an inward (counter-clockwise) or outward (clockwise) fashion.</p><br/>

            <div id="interdefence" class="tab-pane fade">
               <br/><h4>Physical Defence</h4>
               <p>The physical defence is the most basic level of defence. This is just you holding your hands up to cover your face. Your elbows down to cover your body. At the most basic level of boxing, your arms are held in a stationary position, serving as a basic shield against your opponent’s attacks. Keep your guard up!</p><br/>

               <h4>Counter Defence</h4>
               <p>Anytime you attack, you should be aware of how your opponent is most likely to counter back against you. If you’re throwing a jab, expect an overhand right. If you’re throwing a right hand, expect a left hook counter. Anytime you throw a punch, you should have an idea what punch your opponent will attempt to counter with.</p><br/>

               <h4>Intuition and Awareness Defence</h4>
               <p>The awareness defence requires the most skill and elevates your defensive game to a high level. At this level of defence, you use high awareness inside the ring to defend yourself from your opponent’s attacks. Using your awareness will allow you to defend yourself without actually using the physical guard or having to remember what punches your opponent will throw. This will require high level ducking, slipping and footwork to avoid your opponent’s attacks.</p><br/>

               <br/><h4>Double cross uppercut</h4>
               <p>Throw a cross hit with each of your hands, beginning with your dominant, and following up with an uppercut. This is an effective move because it will knock your opponent farther back than if you had just done each move individually, and possibly make him lose his footing.</p><br/>

               <h4>The jab uppercut hook </h4>
               <p>Do a jab to your opponent's face, then an uppercut with the opposite hand, and then a hook with the same hand that you did the jab. The jab will take your opponent off his guard for a second, and the uppercut and the hook will allow for some power.</p><br/>

               <h4>Jab uppercut</h4>
               <p>it is important to do this combination at a high speed to avoid any chance of a counterattack.</p><br/>

               <h4>The hook jab</h3>
               <p>Throw a hook and be sure to do this quickly as for a short second because it will leave you heavily exposed. The point of the hook is to draw the defending hand away from the area of the body that you are focusing on.</p><br/>

            </div>
            <div id="advcombination2" class="tab-pane fade">
               <br/><h4>DoubleJab Cross Hook Kick</h4>
               <p>when you throw a double jab, you can often disrupt your rhythm. Throw a double jab to your opponent's head, followed by a cross and a left hook to the head. Finish the combination with a high kick, which should pass over her guard.</p><br/>

               <h4>Kick Jab Cross</h4>
               <p>Mix up the location of your punches and kicks. keep your opponent guessing. Lead with a low kick and then immediately throw a jab and cross. this combination is effective in a sense that you can use it to set up additional strikes depending on how the opponent reacts.</p><br/>

               <h4>Jab Cross Kick</h4>
               <p>Throw a series of jabs followed by some crosses; three or four jabs and three or four crosses make for an effective high combination. Instead of continuing to pressure her on the ropes, take a quick step backward and throw a roundhouse kick to the head or body, depending on where you see an opening.</p><br/>

               <h4>Jab Kick Cross Uppercut Kick</h4>
               <p>Throw a jab, followed by a left or right kick, depending how she's holding her guard. After the kick, move in quickly with a cross and a left-handed uppercut, which should push her back toward the ropes. Then, quickly throw a front kick to her face with your back foot before she has a chance to escape.</p><br/>

            </div>
            <div id="mentality" class="tab-pane fade">
               <br/><h4>Mentality</h4>
               <p>Mentality is 90% of the game! Everybody trains hard everyone pushes themselves physically, at the top end of every sport, where the tiniest percentage can separate the winners from the losers, the mental edge is more often than not that key defining factor.<br/>

               It is important to enjoy what you do and push yourself as far as you can go. This come with regular training and dedication. Before you know it, you will be able to move quicker, defend better and will defiantly be in fantastic shape. Keep smiling and learn yourself.</p><br/>
